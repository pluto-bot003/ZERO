<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Juice ITC", size = "8">The Resurrection Stone was one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the second Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, as his bounty, something with the power to recall loved ones from Death. According to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows (the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death.

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Juice ITC", size = "8">The Elder Wand was one of three magical objects that made up the fabled Deathly Hallows, along with the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility. According to The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the first Hallow created, supposedly made by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Antioch Peverell after he requested, as his bounty, a wand worthy of someone who had outsmarted Death. According to legend, whoever united the wand with the other two Hallows (the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death.

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Juice ITC", size = "8">The Cloak of Invisibility was a magical artefact used to render the wearer invisible, and one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the third and final Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself (whom had the cloak in his possession at that time).</p>
