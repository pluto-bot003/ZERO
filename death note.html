A Death Note is the titular supernatural notebook used by the Shinigami to sustain their life, as well as a principal figure in the Eponymous series.

<h1> <FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "5">APPEARANCE</FONT></h1>

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "4">While appearing as your typical black notebook, Shinigami are able to choose what adorns their notebooks' covers, if anything. Most notes, however, such as Rem's, are plain black and lack writing on their covers, but Shinigami occasionally write their name on it as a joke.[1] Death Notes can also be red or white, though these types are rare.</p> 

<h2> <FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "5">Overview</FONT></h2>

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "4">The purpose of the Death Note is to take human life, thereby increasing the lifespan of the Shinigami who uses it. There are many rules governing how the Death Note can be used, though the most pivotal rule is that "the human whose name is written in this note shall die." The King of Death is apparently the one that makes and controls the rules of the Death Note, where he is able to make new rules as he sees fit.</p>

<h3> <FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "5">Use by Shinigami</FONT></h3>

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "4">Shinigami normally use Death Notes to kill humans that they see through the observation hole in the Shinigami realm, thereby adding each human's remaining years of life to their own out of fear of dying themselves. Rogue Shinigami occasionally drop extra Death Notes from the Shinigami realm down to the human world, allowing a human the use of their spare killer notebooks. It is unknown how many notebooks exist in the Shinigami realm, as well as how Death Notes are created.</p>

<h4> <font COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "5">Use by Humans</FONT></h4>

<p><FONT COLOR = "white" , face = "Jokerman", size = "4">A Death Note can be used by a human, although their lifespans do not increase by doing so. Historically, humans have either killed other humans with the Death Notes or ended up burning and therefore destroying the Death Note for any number of reasons. Ryuk is the first rogue Shinigami shown in the series, though it is stated early in the series that there have been Death Notes dropped in the human world before.</p>
